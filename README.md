This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Java programming: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This exception occurs when you try to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of indices for that array (0 to array.length - 1). The example includes robust error handling to catch and informatively report the exception. This is crucial for creating robust, user-friendly applications.
